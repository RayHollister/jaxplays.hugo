      <description>Hey there, theatre enthusiasts! I am absolutely thrilled to announce that I am restarting JaxPlays, and this time it&amp;rsquo;s here to stay!
As some of you may recall, the site was initially built on MediaWiki, which proved to be quite cumbersome to maintain and edit. But now, JaxPlays has a fresh new look and is running on Jekyll with a wiki theme. What a game-changer! Jekyll is a static site generator, meaning it creates simple HTML files that can be easily edited and updated.</description>

      <description>Hey folks,
Ray Hollister here, lead editor and developer of JaxPlays.
I started JaxPlays on January 9, 2020. Perhaps not the best timing. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Needless to say, things did not go as we expected for local, live theatre that year or the next.
Now that the Coronavirus situation has settled down, I am excited to get started working on JaxPlays again, adding shows and cast and crew lists. I am working on adding audition announcements and reviews soon, and I expect to have a big announcement in a month or so!</description>
